# BitNet WebGPU PoC

An experimental proof-of-concept aimed at running 1-bit AI models (like Microsoft's BitNet b1.58) natively in JavaScript using WebGPU.

## The Goal
Standard AI relies on heavy floating-point (`f32`) matrix multiplication, which creates a massive memory bottleneck. This PoC explores rewriting the core mathematical kernels in WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) to use ternary weights (-1, 0, 1). 

By replacing complex multiplication with simple addition and subtraction directly on the GPU, we aim to drastically reduce memory bandwidth and make running massive Large Language Models in the browser a reality.

## Current Status
- [x] Initial Repository Setup
- [x] WebGPU environment configuration
- [x] WGSL Compute Shader for ternary math
- [x] Browser-based execution via local web server
- [ ] Extended matrix–vector operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against `f32` multiply

## How It Works

The WGSL compute shader receives an input vector and a ternary weight vector (`{-1, 0, +1}`). Instead of multiplying, it branches on each weight:

| Weight | Operation | Cost |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `+1`   | Copy the input value | One add |
| `-1`   | Negate the input value | One subtract |
| `0`    | Output zero (skip) | Nothing |

This completely eliminates floating-point multiplication, which is the core insight behind BitNet b1.58.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qwatts-dev/bitnet-webgpu-poc.git
   cd bitnet-webgpu-poc
   ```

2. **Start a local web server**
   ```bash
   npx serve . -l 8080
   ```

3. **Open in a WebGPU-capable browser** (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, Safari 18+)
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` — the page will automatically run the ternary-weight compute shader on your GPU and display the results.
